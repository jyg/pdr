how to use:
dlgranulator~ is a delay-line granulator which enables granulation of incoming sounds in realtime by altering the following parameters:

amp
pan
trn - transposition of grain in cents
dur - duration of grain in ms
iot - interonset time (time between successive grains) in ms

The envelope is a 3-stage line segment (ASR) using cosine smoothing and controlled by the following parameters:
shp - % of the envelope used by the S portion
skw - % of time (A+R) used by A.  Higher values of skw will have an upwards ramp /| shape,
and lower values will have a sharper attack |\
An envelope with shp=1 and skw=50 is a quasi-gaussian shape.

dlt - Point in the delay line from which grains are read, up to 8000 ms.
fb  - feedback level (amount of dlgranulator's output which is fed back into the delay line).

voices - highest number of possible simultaneous grains (currently max. 16).  The actual number of grains is determined by dur & iot as well.

each parameter (except fb & voices) is controlled by 2 faders: the left fader controls the center value, and the right fader controls the range of possible values. Each parameter is chosen at random from within those boundaries.

You can send messages to change parameters by wiring a message box to the left outlet of the patch.  See the demo (granulator.pd) for example parameter change messages.
